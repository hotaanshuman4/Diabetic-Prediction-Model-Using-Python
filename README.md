*Diabetes Prediction Model*
The Diabetes Prediction Model is a machine learning–based system designed to predict whether an individual is diabetic or non-diabetic based on clinical and physiological parameters. The project leverages a Random Forest Classifier for accurate prediction and integrates a web-based frontend for real-time user interaction.
The system includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, visualization, and model optimization to ensure reliable predictions. It provides a decision-support tool for preliminary diabetes risk assessment and awareness.
